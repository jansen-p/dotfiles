The current directory is saved in ~/.location.

Works together with i3-workspace groups: The i3-config must be configured such that each time the workspace is changed, getLoc.sh is also executed.
This reads the name of the new workspace, and uses dict.py to translate it into a valid path.
dict.py must be extended depending on usage!

Can define a shortcut which launches programs like ranger directly with this path, for quick navigation.

Main part of the script: fuz.sh

Starts a fuzzy-finder (fzf) in the translated path, in beginning of fuz.sh are the programs for opening filetypes specified (uses ex.sh to open files).
Press ctrl-n to manually switch the working directory of the fuzzy-finder, which opens rofi for selecting new location. Overwrites the file which is set by getLoc.sh
A bit redundant to dict.sh, but here we don't need only a translation to the path but also an interactive script
